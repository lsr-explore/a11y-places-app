# What is Web Accessibility

Web Accessibility means that websites and related tools can be used universally by everyone.  This includes people with disabilities such as
- Auditory
- Cognitive
- Neurological
- Physical
- Speech
- Visual

Designing and developing with accessibility in mind helps people who might experience temporary disabilities (e.g. broken arm, lost glasses) or situational limitations (e.g. bright sunlight).

People with disabilities navigate the web using a variety of assistive devices, a few of which are.
Screen reader - text to speech
Zoom/Magnification
Keyboard only navigation

See the W3 site for videos for perspectives on Web Accessibility and how people with disabilities use the web - <https://www.w3.org/WAI/people/>

Accessibility = Usability + Assistive Technology Compatibility + WCAG/ARIA Compliance

When delivering accessible experiences, compliance with WCAG and ARIA standards is just the baseline. True accessibility also requires good usability and thoughtful consideration of user needs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Image Alt Text
Creating the alt tag for the image, keep in mind what is important to keep the user‚Äôs goal in mind

 https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-red-kite-flying-in-the-sky-with-its-wings-spread-16845928/

Assistive Technology Compatible: <img src=‚Äù...‚Äù, alt=‚Äùa bird flying‚Äù />
Usability + Assistive Technology Compatible: <img src=‚Äù...‚Äù alt=‚ÄùClose-up of a red kite soaring gracefully with wings spread wide against a clear background.‚Äù />

### Example 2: Accessible Button Labels

While a button with just "Edit" text is semantically correct, it is not very usable and can violate WCAG guidelines when the context is ambiguous.

| Name | Assistive Tech Compatible | Usability + AT + WCAG/ARIA |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Chiho Murakami | `<Button>Edit</Button>` | `<Button aria-label="Edit Chiho Murakami">Edit</Button>` |
| John Wagner | `<Button>Edit</Button>` | `<Button aria-label="Edit John Wagner">Edit</Button>` |

## WCAG and ARIA Standards

**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** are a set of principles and rules published by the W3C and adopted as an ISO standard. It is the primary evaluation criteria for accessible web sites. The current version is **WCAG 2.2**.

### WCAG 2.2 Four Core Principles (POUR)

Reference: [WCAG 2.2 Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/)

Each principle is expanded through guidelines categorized into three conformance levels: **A**, **AA**, and **AAA**. Most sites target **Level AA**.

1. **Perceivable**: Content must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
   - Examples: Text alternatives for images, captions for videos, sufficient color contrast

2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
   - Examples: Keyboard access, sufficient time to complete tasks, seizure prevention

3. **Understandable**: Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable
   - Examples: Clear language, predictable behavior, input assistance

4. **Robust**: Content must be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies
   - Examples: Valid HTML, proper ARIA usage, parsing compatibility

### WAI-ARIA 1.2

**Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)** is a set of HTML attributes that communicate additional roles, states, and properties to assistive technologies.

- **Roles**: Define what an element is (e.g., `role="button"`, `role="alert"`)
- **States**: Define the current condition (e.g., `aria-checked="true"`, `aria-expanded="false"`)
- **Properties**: Define additional characteristics (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`)

**Important**: Use semantic HTML first. Only add ARIA when semantic HTML alone is insufficient. 

## üß© Accessibility Practice Checklist

_A quick reference for developers to build and test accessible features._

---

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] All functionality can be reached using **Tab**, **Shift+Tab**, **Enter**, and **Space**.
- [ ] There is a **visible focus indicator** on interactive elements.
- [ ] The tab order follows the **visual and logical order** of the page.
- [ ] A **‚ÄúSkip to main content‚Äù** link is available.

---

### 2. Screen Readers

- [ ] Test with at least one screen reader:
  - macOS/iOS ‚Üí VoiceOver
  - Windows ‚Üí NVDA or JAWS
  - Android ‚Üí TalkBack
- [ ] Confirm all buttons, links, and inputs have **accessible names** (`aria-label`, `<label>`, or inner text).
- [ ] Headings are used hierarchically (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`).
- [ ] Landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) are present.

---

### 3. Forms and Feedback

- [ ] Each input has a visible and programmatic **label**.
- [ ] Error messages identify the problem and **link to the field** (e.g., `aria-describedby`).
- [ ] Status updates (success, error) use a **live region** (`role="alert"` or `aria-live="polite"`).

---

### 4. Color and Contrast

- [ ] Text contrast meets **4.5 : 1** (WCAG 1.4.3).
- [ ] Non-text UI elements meet **3 : 1** (WCAG 1.4.11).
- [ ] Color is never the **only means** of conveying information.
- [ ] Test with **Contrast Finder** or **Figma Contrast Checker**.

---

### 5. Testing and Automation

- [ ] Run `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` regularly.
- [ ] Add a **jest-axe** test to catch accessibility regressions.
- [ ] Use **Playwright + axe** for automated end-to-end scans.
- [ ] Check components in **Storybook a11y** panel before merging.

---

### 6. Continuous Learning

- [ ] Review [WCAG 2.2 Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).
- [ ] Review [ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
- [ ] Share one new accessibility insight during sprint retros or demos.
